# CDIS_GEUVADIS_analysis
R scripts for analysis of GEUVADIS created BAMs

Start by reading the generate_GEV_figures.r file in the GEUVADIS_demo_data folder.

This file has all of the documentation to:
(1) Create visualizations from pre-calculated data (appropriate for demonstration)
(2) Perform all analyses from scratch (you can demonstrate the complete functionality if there is time)
