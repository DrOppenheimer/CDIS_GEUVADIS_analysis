# CDIS_GEUVADIS_analysis
R scripts for analysis of GEUVADIS created BAMs

Start by reading the combine_docker_outputs.README file in the
GEUVADIS_demo_data folder.
It contains all the instructions you should need

This file has all of the documentation to:
(1) Create visualizations from pre-calculated data (appropriate for demonstration)
(2) Perform all analyses from scratch (you can demonstrate the complete functionality if there is time)

As of 11-13-2015
I cloned this repository into the VM that Felix set up ( into ~/git/ )
and was able to reproduce all steps in combine_docker_outputs.README.

I have also included an updated version of the slides in the ./slides
directory
